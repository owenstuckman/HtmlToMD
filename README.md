# HtmlToMD

Quick project in order to learn Scala. 
Converts html to md. 

# Background / Inspiration 

I have a few private projects related to .md formatting and notetaking, so I wanted to see what it would take to convert html files to markdown. 

Overall, just wanted to learn some scala syntax and see possibilities of using it for a backend for a future project, and make it something quick.

# Developing

Ensure to first install the scala cli. Once installed ensure it is installed via:
```bash
scala-cli --version
```

Then to test, run the following command:
```bash
scala-cli run Main.scala -- input.html
```
